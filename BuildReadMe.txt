* Building Audius *

First of all go to the Build directory and unpack the BuildTools.zip package
to get directory Build/BuildTools.

Next run the bat file called BuildWin32.bat to perform a complete build.

NOTE: You need Yasm to compile libmpg123. Get it from http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/
